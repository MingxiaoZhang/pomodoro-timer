# Pomodoro Timer App

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built with React. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The Pomodoro Technique aims to improve productivity and focus by alternating work and rest periods.
